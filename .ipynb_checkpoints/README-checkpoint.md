## Django
All Django code are available here.

### My projects:

#### 1] Whatsapp:

  Have you ever been in a situation where you want to text/send document to someone on whatsapp but dont want to save their number into your contact?????

  By default whatsapp allow us to send messages or share file with only those whose contact's have been saved. 
  So I tought why not write a code that allow us to easily slide into whatsapp without having to save their contact.
  By using this you can easily send messages from any platform whithout the need to even save their number.

#### 2] To-Do:

  I like organizing my daily tasks. This helps me to be more productive. 
  So i just wrote myself a todo app to keep track of my progress and task that i have remaining so that i can plan out my day accordingly.

#### 3] Forms:

  This was just my eagerness to explore how django forms works. 
  I wanted to experience how data from one View is sent to another.

## Convert Un-Scanned pdf to Scanned pdfüî•üî•
 The majority of the time at work, an unscanned pdf document is intrinsically inaccessible since the content of the pdf document is not searchable text.
 
 Here I built a software that converts unscanned PDF files to scanned PDF files.
 
 As a result, manual efforts are avoided, and time is saved for the organization.
