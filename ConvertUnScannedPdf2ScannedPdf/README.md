## Convert Un-Scanned pdf to Scanned pdf
  The majority of the time at work, an unscanned pdf document is intrinsically inaccessible since the content of the pdf document is not searchable text.
  Users cannot choose, modify, or change the PDF for accessibility since certain technologies cannot read or extract the words.
  Users must utilize third-party programs to convert information to PDF in order to do so. This is a very laborious process that can take a long time if there are many papers and multi-page documents to process.
  
  Here built a software that converts unscanned PDF files to scanned PDF files.
  As a result, manual efforts are avoided, and time is saved for the organization.
