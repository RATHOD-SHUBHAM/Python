# MergeSort
Merge Sort : Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves.

# QuickSort
QuickSort : QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

# BubbleSort
Bubble Sort : Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

# HeapSort
Heap sort : Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.

# InsertionSort
Insertion sort : Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.


# Description :
Project contains Algorithms for sorting elements. Project ask the user to specify the size of the input and then generate data in Asencding , Descending , and Random format and store it in a file.
It then read the data generated from the file, sort them in a effective manner and then save it back into an other file. It then plots a graph between the three sort showing the best result.


# Built:
Project has been built on a Anaconda platform using python as the programming language.


# Contains:
Project contains sepearte file for each algorithm .
ie: Merge Sort     : merge.ipynb
    Quick Sort     : quick.ipynb
    Bubble Sort    : bubble.ipynb
    Heap Sort      : heap.ipynb
    Insertion Sort : insertion.ipynb
    
Project also contain code that is a combination of all the Algorithms which can be used for comparison of algorithm.
i.e -> combined.ipynb
