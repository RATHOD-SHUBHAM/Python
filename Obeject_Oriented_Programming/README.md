# OOPS

Object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. 

It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. 

The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
