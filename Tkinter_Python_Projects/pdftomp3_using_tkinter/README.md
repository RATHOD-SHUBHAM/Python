# pdf to mp3

I am a voracious reader. But at times i dont get to read as much.
So i tought how nice it would be to have a program that would read for me, while i drive or cook.

Here is a python program that converts pdf into mp3.
I have used tkinker for this.

## Working:
1] Allow user to choose a .pdf file.  
2] Convert the file into a single string.     
3] Save the file in .mp3 format.

So there we go. We have a .mp3 file, which we can listen to anytime we want.

Enjoy Reading !!!
