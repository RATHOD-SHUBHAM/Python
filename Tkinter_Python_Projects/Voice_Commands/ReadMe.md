# Voice Commands

## 1] Voice Record:

    I have a habit of recording audio explanantion of my work. 
    This helps me understand things better the next time if am stuck at similar kind of problems.

    So I tought why not write a python code that allows me to record audio and save it on my local system.

    While doing so i came across Sound Device and Sound File, these modules helped me record and store audio on local system.

## 2] Shutdown Computer:

    Now that I was sure we can use voice command. 
    I tought why not use this to say shutdown to my system and it automatically shut down.
