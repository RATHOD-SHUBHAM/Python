# Word Cloud or Tag Cloud

### What is a WordCloud?
As per wikipedia - A tag cloud (also known as a word cloud, wordle or weighted list in visual design) is a visual representation of text data, which is often used to depict keyword metadata on websites, or to visualize free form text. 

Here I have created wordCloud with python. This is quite handy for exploring text data and making report more lively.

* Creating basic wordcloud from one to several text documents.
* Adjusting color, size and number of text inside wordcloud
* Mask wordcloud into any shape of our choice
* Mask your wordcloud into any color pattern of your choice

### Installing WordCloud
Wordcloud can be a little tricky to install. If you only need it for plotting a basic wordcloud, then "pip install wordcloud" or "conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud" would be sufficient.

However, the latest version with the ability to mask the cloud into any shape of your choice requires a different method of installation as below:

```
git clone https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git
cd word_cloud
pip install .

```
