# Python 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheers favourite programming language ðŸ¥‚.

  * Here you can find a curated list of python projects. Including data structures, algorithm and much more.
  * Check out Github Cheat Sheet pdf.

### ALL_Algorithms

This folder contains list of all the algorithms:
 1. Merkle Tree: In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every "leaf" (node) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.

## Django
All Django code are available here.

#### 1] Whatsapp:

  Have you ever been in a situation where you want to text/send document to someone on whatsapp but dont want to save their number into your contact?????

  By default whatsapp allow us to send messages or share file with only those whose contact's have been saved. 
  So I tought why not write a code that allow us to easily slide into whatsapp without having to save their contact.
  By using this you can easily send messages from any platform whithout the need to even save their number.

#### 2] To-Do:

  I like organizing my daily tasks. This helps me to be more productive. 
  So i just wrote myself a todo app to keep track of my progress and task that i have remaining so that i can plan out my day accordingly.

#### 3] Forms:

  This was just my eagerness to explore how django forms works. 
  I wanted to experience how data from one View is sent to another.

## Convert Un-Scanned pdf to Scanned pdfðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
 The majority of the time at work, an unscanned pdf document is intrinsically inaccessible since the content of the pdf document is not searchable text.
 
 Here I built a software that converts unscanned PDF files to scanned PDF files.
 
 As a result, manual efforts are avoided, and time is saved for the organization.

* Adjusting color, size and number of text inside wordcloud
* Mask wordcloud into any shape of our choice
* Mask your wordcloud into any color pattern of your choice

### Developing RESTful APIs with Python and Flask.

REST stands for representational state transfer and is a software architecture style that defines a pattern for client and server communications over a network. REST provides a set of constraints for software architecture to promote performance, scalability, simplicity, and reliability in the system.

REST defines the following architectural constraints:

 1. Stateless: The server wonâ€™t maintain any state between requests from the client.
 2. Client-server: The client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently.
 3. Cacheable: The data retrieved from the server should be cacheable either by the client or by the server.
 4. Uniform interface: The server will provide a uniform interface for accessing resources without defining their representation.
 5. Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or load balancer.
 6. Code on demand (optional): The server may transfer code to the client that it can run, such as JavaScript for a single-page application.
